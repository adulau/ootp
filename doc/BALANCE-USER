How to use the OARnet One Time Password system.

    Your account on xxx.oar.net now requires the use of a
    One Time Password to login.

    The OTP is generated by your smart card and displayed on the
    balance reader.

    When logging in to xxx an additional prompt will request your HOTP
    challenge.  To generate this insert the smart card with the gold
    contact area on top into the balance reader.  The balance reader
    should have the LCD facing up.

    Wait a few seconds for the challenge to be computed.  This will
    be presented to you as a 40 bit hexadecimal number (10 digits).
    Hexadecimal or base 16 uses 0-9 and A-F.  So a valid response
    could be 094FA3EBCD.  An invalid response would be ZJKL1234UU
    because Z,J,K,L,U are not valid hex digits.

    Type the reponse in and your login will continue as normal.

    During this trial period yyy.oar.net does not require 
    a OTP so if you have problems accessing xxx log into yyy
    first then ssh to xxx.

    The Challenge number must remain loosely synchronized between
    the login server and the smart card, so do not insert the
    smart card unless you're trying to login.  Each time the
    card is inserted a counter is increased.  The Window is
    configured for 10 right now, so it's safe to do this a few
    times just not 10 in a row.
